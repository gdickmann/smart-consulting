## How to run the application
First, make sure that you have all Java required packages installed on your machine, then execute:
```
java -jar main.jar input.txt
```
The input file must contain each phone number separated by a break line. Example:

```
+55 94388345
+852 983 283 983
+1 4846301736
```

Thanks for the opportunity!
